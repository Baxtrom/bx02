Custom 3d printed hand-wired split mechanical keyboard 

latest QMK code, wiring diagram and cad files are provided. 
**(PLEASE NOTE: wiring diagram pins do not match the code as i accidentally switched some wires around, use an avr pinout diagram to map the right pins in info.json)**.
I have also previously made a full design, build + code breakdown here [https://github.com/Baxtrom/bx01/blob/main/setup.md](https://github.com/Baxtrom/bx01/blob/main/setup.md)
