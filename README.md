Custom 3d printed hand-wired split mechanical keyboard 

latest QMK code, wiring diagram and cad files are provided. 
**(PLEASE NOTE: wiring diagram pins do not match the code as i accidentally switched some wires around, use an avr pinout diagram to map the right pins in info.json)**.
I have also previously made a full design, build + code breakdown which i added here (setup.md) or you can find the original [here](https://github.com/Baxtrom/bx01/blob/main/setup.md).

# This build uses: 
- PBT keycaps 
- Akko silver pro v3 (budget linear switches)
- Knockoff arduino pro micro
- Durock stabilizer (2u, for the space key)
- 1N4148 diodes (installed in collumn2row direction)
- 24 gauge cable (tinned copper + solid core) 
- 205 g0. Used to lube stabilizer and switches
- Small elastics (brace elastics work well). Used to reduce switch wobble in the plate. Wrap them under the lip of the switch before you click them in
- M2 screws and heatset inserts
- Type-C breakout boards
- One sacrificial Micro usb cable
